# Weed Mapping in Satellite Images

This project performs **vegetation cover, exposed soil, and weed infestation mapping** in agricultural crops, using **supervised neural networks** and multispectral images with 4 bands (RGB + Alpha). The objective is to provide visual and statistical analysis to support **agronomic decision-making**, such as agricultural pesticide application and crop monitoring throughout all stages of the cycle.

# Using Georeferenced Imagery in Agriculture

Segmented and georeferenced imagery plays a crucial role in modern precision agriculture. By mapping field boundaries and detecting weed-infested areas at the pixel level, farmers can plan highly targeted interventions ‚Äî especially when leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as agricultural drones.

</p>

When combined with drone technology, georeferenced data enables:

- **Targeted spraying**, significantly reducing herbicide waste  
- **Optimized route planning**, saving time and fuel  
- **Access to difficult terrain**, where tractors can't operate  
- **Soil preservation**, as drones avoid compaction entirely  
- **Lower operational costs**, requiring less labor and fewer inputs  

This approach turns conventional spraying into precise, site-specific treatment, reducing costs, environmental impact, and damage to soil structure.

Based on this scenario, we will now estimate the total cost required to treat all weed-affected areas identified in the classified image.

## Process Steps

1. **Reading the multispectral image (.tif)**
2. **Sample collection** via shapefile polygons (.shp) of:
   - Exposed soil
   - Healthy vegetation
   - Weeds
3. **Training an MLP neural network (Keras)** to classify pixels by color
4. **Predicting the entire image** based on the trained model
5. **Visualization of the classified and segmented image**
6. **Generation of statistics**:
   - Proportion by class
   - Total area in hectares by class
   - Infestation index
   - Estimated consumption of herbicide, water, and energy
7. **Export of graphical reports and images**

## üìå Observations

- The image must contain an alpha channel to separate valid pixels (value 255).
- Samples are fundamental to train an efficient model. Use shapefiles with well-defined polygons.
- The total area is converted from pixels to hectares based on the image resolution (spatial resolution).
